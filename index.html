<p>Hi! My name is Danny, I'm a Data Scientist at JPMorgan Chase with 5 years of experience - where I work on making the ecosystems of 5000 branches nationwide better for our customers. I previously worked at SwagUp, a mid-sized e-commerce startup. I have a BBA from Baruch College and I'm finishing my MS in Analytics at Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>This portfolio showcases my work in data science, including projects on machine learning, causal inference, data visualization, and analytics.</p>
<p>With a lot of the hype surrounding data science nowadays, I wanted to focus my portfolio as a reflection of my learning journey on my way to becoming a better data scientist. I want to include the lessons - the little details that not everyone covers - that genuinely helped me along the way. I did not come from a traditional mathematics oriented background, so along my journey, I appreciated the need to learn data science not from a "tech stack" or "technology" perspective but rather from a perspective of "how does this work - and where can I actually use this?"</p>
<p>Outside of work, I love playing chess. I authored 3 chess books on various opening theory from the French Defense to the Rossolimo which still sell on Chessable.com - but nowadays I have an addiction to bullet chess. I am also a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu enthusiast - and I'm working on my next belt progression. I love to paint, go on long walks, listen to all kinds of music (Everything from Gregorio Allegri to Tool to Billy Idol) and staying curious</p>
