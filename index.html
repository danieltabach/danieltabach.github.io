<p>I'm Danny, a Senior Data Scientist at JPMorgan Chase with 5 years of experience. Previously worked at SwagUp, a mid-sized e-commerce startup. I have a BBA from Baruch College and I'm finishing my MS in Analytics at Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>I build things - optimization platforms, ML pipelines, dashboards that actually get used. I care about the full arc: messy data to clean models to visuals that tell a story.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I play chess, train jiu-jitsu, and read too much fantasy.</p>
