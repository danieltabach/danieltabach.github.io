I am a Data Scientist focused on building production systems that drive measurable business impact through optimization, causal inference, and machine learning.

My work centers on turning complex operational problems into tractable decision frameworks. I have experience designing resource allocation platforms, causal experimentation pipelines, and forecasting systems that operate at enterprise scale.

## Background

I am currently completing my **MS in Analytics (Computational Data Science)** at Georgia Institute of Technology, expected May 2026.

I hold a **BBA in Computer Information Systems (Data Analytics)** from Baruch College, City University of New York.

## Technical Skills

**Core Methods**
Causal Inference, Experiment Design, Optimization Modeling (MILP), Statistical Analysis, Time Series, Impact Analysis

**Machine Learning**
XGBoost, Ensemble Methods, Tree-Based Models, Clustering, Regression Modeling

**Languages & Tools**
Python, SQL, R, Spark, Snowflake, AWS, GCP, BigQuery, Tableau, Git

## Current Interests

- Decision systems that combine optimization with ML forecasting
- Rigorous causal inference for policy evaluation
- Scalable experimentation frameworks
- ML monitoring and drift detection
