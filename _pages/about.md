I'm Danny, a Senior Data Scientist at JPMorgan Chase based in New York.

My day-to-day involves building large-scale optimization platforms, designing experiments, and translating technical work into things executives actually care about. But I don't think of myself as an "optimization guy" or an "ML guy." I like the full stack: wrangling messy data, figuring out the right approach, writing clean code, building something that works, and then telling the story of why it matters.

I treat data science as an art form. Most problems have multiple valid solutions, and I find the interesting part is figuring out which one actually fits the situation, then executing it well. I'm pragmatic about this. I know when an idea isn't working and when to pivot.

## Background

**MS in Analytics (Computational Data Science)** at Georgia Institute of Technology, expected May 2026.

**BBA in Computer Information Systems (Data Analytics)** from Baruch College, CUNY.

## What I Work With

**Methods:** Optimization modeling, causal inference, experiment design, time series, statistical analysis, ML (gradient boosting, tree-based models, clustering)

**Stack:** Python, SQL, R, Spark, Snowflake, AWS, GCP, Tableau, Git

## Outside of Work

When I'm not at a keyboard, I play chess, train jiu-jitsu, and read too much fantasy. I'm based in New York.
